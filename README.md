# rememberry ü´ê
Rememberry is a web app that combines the value of spaced repetition of flashcards and visualisation of mind maps. 
Every user can create their own maps that have a tree-shaped design where the branches are the topics,
and the leaves at the end are just regular flashcards.
The main goal is that when users are trying to learn for their upcoming exam,
instead of just learning with plain flashcards, they can create a map that immediately shows how certain topics and flashcards are connected.

## Current status
The backend, built with tRPC, supports user registration and login, and CRUD operations on most
resources such as maps, stacks and flashcards are working (most routes are protected by an authoraziation middleware).

The frontend is still lacking many user interfaces, as well as the complete integration with the backend in its current state.

The CI pipeline is working as intendend and checks if all tests run, if the code is correctly formatted and whether it can be successfully built.

The CD pipeline only deploys on tag creation on our Kubernetes cluster in staging environment.

## Staging deployments
[Website](https://web.stage.rememberry.app/) (only "`/`" "`/login`" "`/map`" available)

[Api](https://api.stage.rememberry.app/)


## Prerequisites
- NPM
- Nodejs (version 20)
- Bun (version 1.0.9)
- Docker

## Development Setup
Install prerequisites and clone the repository and navigate into root folder

Create a `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env.example` in the .env and change the value accordingly 
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Go into the frontend folder and install all dependencies and copy env files
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ cp .env.example .env.local
$ npm i
$ cd ..
```

Go into the backend folder and install all dependencies and copy env files !!Important we are using bun for the backend!!
```bash
$ cd backend
$ cp .env.example .env
$ bun install
$ cd ..
```

Go back to the root folder and run the start_docker_environment file (make sure docker is running)
```bash
$ ./start_docker_environment
```

Go into the frontend folder and run with npm
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm run dev
```

!! It is not possible to run the frontend in the same docker network (at least I haven't figured out how) due to CORS issues (or something similiar)

This will do the following (The ports are based of the `.env.example` and docker-compose.yml):
1. Create the database container running on port `5432` and apply the database migration generated by drizzle 
2. Create the backend container running on port `3050` and connects to the database inside of the docker network
  - http://localhost:3050/
3. Start the frontend website on port `3000`
  - http://localhost:3000

Since there is no connection with the backend yet, there is not really a lot happening yet.

These are some of the noticable endpoints on the frontend
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3000/login
- http://localhost:3000/map

Development environment is also slightly ahead of staging at this point
