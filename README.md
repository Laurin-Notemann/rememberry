# rememberry ü´ê
Rememberry is a web app that combines the value of spaced repetition of flashcards and visualization of mind maps, by combining these two elements.
Every user can create their own maps that has a tree shaped design where the branches are the topics and the leaves at the end are just regular flashcard.
The main goal is that when users are trying to learn for their upcoming exam instead of just learning with plain flashcard where it is difficult to have 
connections between individual flashcards, they can create a map that immidietly shows how certain topics and flashcards are connected. 

## Current status
The backend built with tRPC supports user registration and login, and CRUD operations on most
resources such as maps, stacks and flashcards are working (most routes are protected by an authoraziation middleware).

The frontend is still lacking a lot of interfaces and also the complete connection to the frontend at its current state.

The CI pipeline is working as intendend and checks if all tests run, if the code is correctly formatted and if it can build.

The CD pipeline only deploys on tag creation on our Kubernetes cluster in staging environment.

## Staging deployments
[Website](https://web.stage.rememberry.app/)
<br>
[Api](https://api.stage.rememberry.app/)


## Prerequisites
- NPM
- Nodejs (version 20)
- Bun (version 1.0.9)
- Docker

## Development Setup
Install prerequisites and clone the repository and navigate into root folder

Create a .env file and copy the contents of .env.example in the .env and change the value accordingly 
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Go into the frontend folder and install all dependencies and copy env files
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ cp .env.example .env.local
$ npm i
$ cd ..
```

Go into the backend folder and install all dependencies and copy env files !!Important we are using bun for the backend!!
```bash
$ cd backend
$ cp .env.example .env
$ bun install
$ cd ..
```

Go back to the root folder and run the start_docker_environment file (make sure docker is running)
```bash
$ ./start_docker_environment
```

Go into the frontend folder, copy the .env.example into .env.local and run with npm
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env.local
$ cd frontend
$ npm run dev
```

!! It is not possible to run the frontend in the same docker network (at least I haven't figured out how) due to CORS issues (or something similiar)

This will do the following (The ports are based of the .env.example and docker-compose.yml):
1. Create the database container running on port 5432 and apply the database migration generated by drizzle 
2. Create the backend container running on port 3050 and connects to the database inside of the docker network
  - http://localhost:3050/
3. Start the frontend website on port 3000
  - http://localhost:3000
