# rememberry ü´ê

Rememberry is a web app that combines the value of spaced repetition of flashcards and visualisation of mind maps.
Every user can create their own maps that have a tree-shaped design where the branches are the topics,
and the leaves at the end are just regular flashcards.
The main goal is that when users are trying to learn for their upcoming exam,
instead of just learning with plain flashcards, they can create a map that immediately shows how certain topics and flashcards are connected.

## Staging deployments

[Website](https://web.stage.rememberry.app/) 
<br>
[Api](https://api.stage.rememberry.app/)

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) - Version 18 (as a runtime)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) - Version 1.1 (as a package manager)
- Docker - Version 25.0.3

> It is recommended to install `node` with nvm and then set the `node` version with `nvm use 18`.

## Development Setup

> Please note that this repository is using `bun` as a package manger instead of `npm`.

> This tuturial is written on and for unix like systems.


Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rememberry-io/rememberry

cd rememberry
```

Configure environment
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Install all dependencies
```bash
bun i
```

Go back to the root folder and run the start_docker_environment file (make sure docker is running)
```bash
$ ./start_docker_environment
```

Go into the frontend folder and run with npm

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm run dev
```
This will do the following (The ports are based of the `.env.example` and docker-compose.yml):

1. Create the database container running on port `5432` and apply the database migration generated by drizzle
2. Create the backend container running on port `3050` and connects to the database inside of the docker network

- http://localhost:3050/

3. Start the frontend website on port `3000`

- http://localhost:3000

Since there is no connection with the backend yet, there is not really a lot happening yet.

These are some of the noticable endpoints on the frontend

- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3000/login
- http://localhost:3000/map

Development environment is also slightly ahead of staging at this point

## Noticable Technologies

- Typescript
- tRPC
- Postgres
- Drizzle
- Nextjs
